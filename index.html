      <p class="Animals">
        The producer in Antarctica are tiny organisms, known as phytoplankton.
        These organisms get their energy from the sunlight. Krill is then the
        main consumer of the phytoplankton, which is eaten by many other
        organisms such as penguins, birds, or elephant seals. They are only two
        inches long.
